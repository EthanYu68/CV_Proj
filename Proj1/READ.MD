For project 1, you will modify an existing Siamese Tracker to add functionality that makes it (hopefully) work better.  
We spent an entire class period talking about project 1 and various ideas for ways to  add "traditional" tracking ideas to a modern Siamese Tracker framework.  
Those slides are here: SiameseTrackingIdeas.pdfPreview the document .
